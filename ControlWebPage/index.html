			<h3> Introduction </h3>
			<p>Control systems engineering is the discipline whose main goal is to make systems to have a desired behavior.</p>

			<p>In these lessons we are going to explore the fundamentals of control systems and how we can apply the techniques of control theory to modify the behavior of a system in order to make it  faster, precise and avobe all...stable.</p>

			<p>The control course is divided in the  following sections...</p>

		</section>

		<section>
			<a href = "controlsys.html"><h3> Control Systems Introduction</h3></a>
			<p>Here we explore de fundamentals of control systems theory to have an outlook of the topics and its possible applications. Also, we explore the common configurations of control systems: open loop and feedback loop systems.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<a href = "response.html"><h3> Time Response</h3></a>
			<p>Here we learn how the output response of a system is related with the input and what we call <strong> the transfer function</strong>.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<a href= "error.html"><h3> Steady State Error</h3></a>
			<p>In this section we'll learn about the error between what we desire the output to be and what it really is as time tends to infinite. Learning about how the error is related with the system <em>type</em> will provide us the knowledge to make more precise systems.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<a href="stability.html"><h3> Stability</h3></a>
			<p>Stability is without any doubt <strong>the most important concept in control</strong>. An unstable system cannot be controled and therefore is a waste of resources. Achieving stability is the key and first step to obtain the desired response of a system.</p>
		</section>


		<section>
			<a href="blocks.html"><h3> Block Diagrams</h3></a>
			<p>Systems are usually complex. The more advanced the system the more complex its structure. Examples of this can be mechatronics systems, which combine mechanics, electronics, control and informatic elements that work together to achieve a final goal. A coomon example is a car that is comprised of power systems, damping systems, motor and traction systems , etc. So, in this section we learn how to simplify this complex systems formed of multiple subsystems (or blocks) in only one system (or block) with the three fundamental parts: input, system and output.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<a href="lgr.html"><h3> Root Locus</h3></a>
			<p>In this section we'll learn a powefull graphical method to describe and analyse de system behavior. This method will help us in the design of systems that when added to the plant or process modify the output behavior without making a trade-off that is usually seen when we only modify the gain of the feedback loop.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<a href="controld.html"><h3> Control Design</h3></a>
			<p>There are some methods to design controllers. Here we explore the root locus method as an analytical tool to design controllers. We'll also learn heuristical methods that are very common in industry.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<a href="bode.html"><h3> Bode</h3></a>
			<p>This is one of the most useful sections and one that can be used in many subjects. Bode plots are found to be extremely useful in circuits, electronics, filters and control design. They give us a different perspective since allow us to see the system behavior in a different way, relating the output behavior with the frecuency of the input.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<a href="digital.html"><h3> Digital Control</h3></a>
			<p>In this last section we explore how to take a controller designed with the past techniques and implement it in a microcontroller as a bunch of equations.</p>
